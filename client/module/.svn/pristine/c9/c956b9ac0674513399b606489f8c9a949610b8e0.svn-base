This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used when making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included. EXW means that a seller has the goods ready for collection at his premises (works, factory, warehouse, plant) on the date agreed upon. The buyer pays all transportation costs and also bears the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. The seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export. If the seller does load the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If parties wish seller to be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.","flags":null,"id":"1","is_demo_data":"0","modified":"2013-11-25 20:23:51","modified_by":"1","name":"EXW","owned_by":"1","revision":"2"},{"created":"2013-11-25 18:42:31","created_by":"1","deleted":"0","description":"The seller delivers goods, cleared for export, to the buyer-designated carrier at a named and defined location.

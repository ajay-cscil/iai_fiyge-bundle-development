Say that you'll be writing, and ask to confirm\r\n\t\t\t precise address, name and title details etc. The old convention was to use Sir\r\n\t\t\t or Madam if you'd not spoken to the person before, but nowadays it's reasonably\r\n\t\t\t safe to use Mr\/Mrs\/Ms (surname). <\/p> \r\n\t <p> <b><font size=\"+1\">headline <\/font><\/b><\/p> \r\n\t <p>If you use a headline or 'banner statement' it must be concise,\r\n\t\trelevant, impactful, professional, unique, new. Maximum 15-20 words. Generally\r\n\t\tavoid 'clever' glib ad-type slogans. Avoid upper case (capitals) lettering -\r\n\t\tword-shapes are lost when upper case is used. (People read by recognising\r\n\t\tword-shapes not individual letters, so don't use upper case anywhere, as it\r\n\t\ttakes longer to read and reduces impact.) Avoid italics, coloured backgrounds\r\n\t\tand coloured text too - they all reduce readability and impact. Headline should\r\n\t\tbe between two-thirds and three-quarters up the page - where the eye-line is\r\n\t\tnaturally first attracted. Often it's easier to decide on your headline after\r\n\t\tyou've written the rest of the letter. The headline is extremely important -\r\n\t\ttake time to refine it into a really powerful and meaningful statement (or\r\n\t\tquestion).<\/p> \r\n\t\t  <p> <font size=\"+1\"><b> credibility and relevance\r\n\t\t\t statement<\/b><\/font><\/p> \r\n\t <p> Refer to significant and beneficial activities of your company in\r\n\t\tareas\/sectors\/industries relevant to the target's business. Technical and\r\n\t\tcomplex words help, provided they are relevant and that your target recipient\r\n\t\twill understand them. Using technical words that are relevant and recognisable\r\n\t\tto your contact will help to convey that you understand the issues and details\r\n\t\tfrom their perspective. Use 'director-speak' - words and phrases that directors\r\n\t\tuse and relate to. Given that most introductory letters avoid mentioning prices\r\n\t\tmany decision-makers find it refreshingly 'up front' and honest - no nonsense -\r\n\t\tto see clear early indication of financials - if only as a guide. Logically it\r\n\t\thelps to relate prices or costs to expected returns. Remember that most\r\n\t\tdecision-makers in organisations are fundamentally driven by return on\r\n\t\tinvestment. There can be risks in using direct references to the target's\r\n\t\tcompetitors, so be careful - it's more acceptable in aggressively competitive\r\n\t\tmarkets - less so in more conservative sectors. Use references that you believe\r\n\t\tare likely to be the most unique and beneficial and relevant, (which is why\r\n\t\tdoing some initial research is useful). Focus on a single theme and result - do\r\n\t\tnot try to list lots of benefits. As a general rule, be specific but not\r\n\t\tdetailed, and be broad but not vague. Ensure your proposition has the WIIFM\r\n\t\tfactor - 'What's in it for me?' - your contact must feel that it's worth his or\r\n\t\ther time in pursuing some interest or accepting your call. <\/p> \r\n\t <p> <b><font size=\"+1\">how and why statement <\/font><\/b><\/p> \r\n\t\t  <p>If you need to explain how the benefits are derived then do so. Keep\r\n\t\t\t it general, concise, significant, serious and brief. This is a good place to\r\n\t\t\t imply or suggest the uniqueness of your capability. It is useful to suggest or\r\n\t\t\t state that your company is 'the only' company able to do whatever you are\r\n\t\t\t claiming. Uniqueness is very helpful.<\/p> \r\n\t <p> <font size=\"+1\"><b>suggestion of similar opportunity\/application\r\n\t\t<\/b><\/font><\/p> \r\n\t\t  <p>Suggest that similar opportunities or possibilities might or may\r\n\t\t\t exist for the target organisation. Don't sell, claim or guarantee to be able to\r\n\t\t\t do anything. Understatement is a very useful style. How can you possibly know\r\n\t\t\t for sure until you've understood the client's situation?<\/p> \r\n\t <p> <font size=\"+1\"><b>action\/follow up statement <\/b><\/font><\/p> \r\n\t\t  <p>What you will do next - normally that you'll telephone\r\n\t\t\t soon\/shortly\/in due course. Avoid stating a date and time that you'll phone\r\n\t\t\t back - it's presumptuous - how do you know your target person will be available\r\n\t\t\t then? (In practice if your target is interested in pursuing the issue\r\n\t\t\t opportunity then he or she will normally ask the secretary to deal with the\r\n\t\t\t arrangements for the next action, and you may not actually need to speak to\r\n\t\t\t your target person on the telephone - secretaries and p.a.'s are powerful\r\n\t\t\t people.) <\/p> \r\n\t <p> <font size=\"+1\"><b>sign-off <\/b><\/font><\/p> \r\n\t <p>Stick to tradition to be safe: use Yours sincerely if you've started\r\n\t\twith a Dear Mr\/Mrs\/Ms (name), and Yours faithfully (if you've started with Dear\r\n\t\tSir or Madam).<\/p> \r\n\t <p><b><font size=\"+1\">P.S.<\/font> <\/b><\/p> \r\n\t\t  <p>If it fits with the tone and style of the communication, a good\r\n\t\t\t 'P.S.', used effectively and appropriately, can be a useful way to attract more\r\n\t\tattention and to add an additional point, especially one of special interest to\r\n\t\tthe prospect, for instance that you will be in their area during a week or\r\n\t\tmonth, or a special offer, or the availability of extra pre-sales information\r\n\t\tat a website, etc. Avoid using this for senior contacts because it can be seen\r\n\t\tas gimmicky, and generally if in doubt don't use it.

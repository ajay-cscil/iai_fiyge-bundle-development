[{"id":"1","note_no":"","title":"The most common example of a hierarchical encoding scheme is the ZIP code","content":"The most common example of a hierarchical encoding scheme is the ZIP code,<br>which partitions the United States geographically. Each digit, as you read from<br>left to right, further isolates the location of the address first by postal region,<br>then by state, then by city, and finally, by the post office that has to make the<br>delivery. For example, given the ZIP code 30310, we know that the 30000 to<br>39999 range is in the southeastern United States. Within the southeastern<br>codes we know that the 30000 to 30399 range is Georgia and that 30300 to<br>30399 is metropolitan Atlanta. Finally, the whole code, 30310, identifies<br>substation \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153A\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 in the West End section of the city. The ZIP code can be parsed<br>by reading it from left to right, reading first one digit, then two, and then the<br>last two digits.<br>","related_to":"27","related_to_model":"contacts","__related_to":"bbbbbbbbbbbb","note_category_id":"1","created_by":"1","modified_by":"1","owned_by":null,"created":"2011-08-24 17:04:10","modified":"2013-05-23 16:27:18","deleted":"1","revision":"0","flags":"0"},{"id":"2","note_no":"","title":"bid for an apple mac book ","content":"when time permits just visit the site for bidding<br>","related_to":"50","related_to_model":"campaigns","__related_to":"Apple Mac for $1","note_category_id":"1","created_by":"1","modified_by":"1","owned_by":"0","created":"2011-08-24 17:04:10","modified":"2013-09-13 01:06:39","deleted":"1","revision":"0","flags":"0"},{"id":"3","note_no":"","title":"Call Information","content":"The initial sales call went well.
